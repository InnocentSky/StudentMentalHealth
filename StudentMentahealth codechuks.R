# So i learnt about an exciting feature about R programming on how to use piping from
#your dataset to your ggplot graphics, so i decided to a pratice with this "Student Menta Health
# dataset.

# By the way Shoutout to Greg Martin for the tutorials. 

 **Disclaimer:** The whole point of this work is not really about the Student mental Health, but rather it is basically about practicing piping in R programming from the dataset to ggplot visualization.

### About Dataset

* **A STATISTICAL RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS OF MENTAL HEALTH ON STUDENTSâ€™ CGPA** dataset
This Data set was collected by a survey conducted by Google forms from University student in order to examine their current academic situation and mental health.

* For more details about the Student Mental Health data set see [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shariful07/student-mental-health).
